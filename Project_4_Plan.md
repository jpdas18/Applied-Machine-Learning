# Project 4 Plan - Due May 7
#### Final Project Description

#### Problem Statement: I would like to contribute to existing research focused on developing a name classifier which uses machine learning techniques to classify names according to ethnicity. I began working on this research project during in an independent study in computational sociology that I pursued with Professor Bakhtiari, a professor in William & Mary's sociology department. This research is part of his overarching investigation into health populations for Arab populations in the United States. The problem inspiring the development of the existing method is the difficulty in studying health outcomes for Arab populations due to a lack of specific ethnicity data in existing administrative records. That is, people of Arab descent are often classified as "white", so unless they are foreign born and their country of origin is listed, it is nearly impossible to study health outcomes for this population using records - unless one is able to employ the use of a classification method. 

#### I previously worked on a long short term memory model which trains on list of names and the associated ethnicities or countries of origin and then can be used to classify names inputted. For this project, I have several potential ideas to either develop a completely new method with which to to compare the existing model or perhaps improve on the long short term memory model I have already used.

#### A description of data: I am using a dataset which includes 148,275 names scraped from Wikipedia and the race or ethnicity associated with each name. This dataset was collected by Steven Skiena's research team with the same end goal of building a name classifier. The classes of race/ethnicity are: 'GreaterEuropean,WestEuropean,Germanic', 'GreaterAfrican,Muslim', 'GreaterEuropean,WestEuropean,Nordic', 'GreaterEuropean,WestEuropean,Hispanic', 'GreaterEuropean,Jewish','GreaterAfrican,Africans', 'Asian,GreaterEastAsian,Japanese', 'GreaterEuropean,WestEuropean,French','GreaterEuropean,EastEuropean', 'GreaterEuropean,British','Asian,GreaterEastAsian,EastAsian', 'Asian,IndianSubContinent','GreaterEuropean,WestEuropean,Italian'. I have condensed all the variations of European ethnic grouping to a single European class because I think it is ridiculous to have such a high degree of specificity for the European class and no specificity for the other classes. Perhaps this is a result of the dataset being skewed towards European names, but to me it seemed almost racist when there are equally many or even more categories within other classes (for example, the Asian or African classes could have been subdivided as well). 

#### Machine learning method: I am planning to use a boosted trees model to predict names for my data. I will then compare its performance to the long short term memory model I have previously used as a name classifier.
