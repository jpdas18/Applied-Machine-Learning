### Project 3
##### Selected Country: Ethiopia 
##### I chose to work with Ethiopia because I had worked with Ethiopia for Project 2 and wanted to learn more about the country.
##### Using two machine learning methods, predict population values at 100 x 100 meter resolution throughout your selected country. I chose to apply a simple linear model as well as a random forest model.
#### Validate the two models using different methods presented in this class. 
#### Write a report assessing the two approaches and which of the two models was more accurate.
#### Be sure to account for spatial variation throughout your selected location and provide substantive explanations for why those variations occurred.
