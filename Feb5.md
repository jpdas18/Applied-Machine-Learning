### A. In the video, "First steps in computer vision", Laurence Moroney introduces us to the Fashion MNIST data set and using it to train a neural network in order to teach a computer how to see. One of the first steps towards this goal is splitting the data into two groups, a set of training images and labels and a set of test images and labels. Why is this done? What is the purpose of splitting the data into a training set and a test set?
### B. The fashion MNIST example has increased the number of layers in our neural network from 1 in the past example, now to 3. The last two are Dense layers that have activation arguments using the relu and softmax funtions...
