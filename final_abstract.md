### Applying an RNN to Classify Names According to Ethnicity: Final Project Abstract

#### Problem Statement
#### There are plenty of datasets such as administrative records which could be useful for demographic research - however, many lack specific ethnicity information for certain groups or ethnicity records altogether. For example, in many administrative records, people of Arab descent are classified as "white." Although this is technically an ethnic classification, it is ambiguous and it proves to be an obstacle to scholars wishing to use these records to study Arab populations. The problem statement for this research project is how leverage machine learning techniques to classify names according to the appropriate ethnicity (with groupings and specificity levels corresponding to that of the training set). 
#### This problem was inspired by Professor Bakhtiari medical sociology research in William & Mary's sociology department, which I work on as a research assistant focused on the computational side of things. In my capacity as a research assistant, I have applied a Naive Bayes classifier and Long Short Term Memory model to classify names. For this project, I decided I wanted to apply a different method to see if it would work and if it could improve upon the previous two.
