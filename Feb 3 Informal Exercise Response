## Informal Exercise Response:
## Question 1: In Laurence Maroney's video "What is ML", he compares traditional programming with machine learning and argues that the main difference between the two is a reorientation of the rules, data, and answers. According to Maroney, what is the difference between traditional programming and machine learning?
## Maroney thinks of programming as a configuration of data, rules, and answers. He describes traditional programming as the inputting of data and rules and the output is the answers. In traditional programming, programmers are generally responsible for determining the rules through the code, which output answers based on the data. Machine learning is relevant when there are lots of data and answers but no rules. Machine learning takes in the data and answers and outputs the rules, so that people can better understand and predict. 

## Question 2: With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31). Modify the predict function to produce the output for the value 7. Do this twice and provide both answers. Are they the same? Are they different? Why is this so?
## When using a model to predict an output for the value 7, I get the same output (21.997128) both times I ran the line of code. However, if I rerun the model although the predictions for 7 are still equal to each other for this model, they are different (although very close to) from the predictions from before. This is interesting to note. It makes sense that the outputs are similar; however, I do not understand why they are different from each other if I rerun the models.

## Using the script you produced to predict housing price, take the provided six houses and train a neural net model that estimates the relationship between them. Based on this model, which of the six homes present a good deal? Which one is the worst deal?
